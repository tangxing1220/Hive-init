# man nslookup: query Internet name servers interactively.
# Nslookup is a program to query Internet domain name servers. Nslookup has
# two modes: interactive and non-interactive. Interactive mode allows the user
# to query name servers for information about various hosts and domains or to
# print a list of hosts in a domain. Non-interactive mode is used to print just
# the name and requested information for a host or domain.
